# Final Project

For our final project, we wanted to create an Allergy Forecast Application. 

We used the Google Maps Pollen API to get forecast data for 1 or 5 days!

### Google Maps Pollen API
The forecast endpoint provides up to 5 days of daily pollen information. You can control the following information that is shown to users:

* Number of forecast days
* Language code for translated fields
* Response page size
* Detailed information about a given area's plants and their allergenic potential

### Other Sources
We used Mary's Theme by Stelvio Cipriani as background audio!
